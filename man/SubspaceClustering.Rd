\title{Algorithms for Subspace clustering}
\description{
Subspace clustering is a technique which finds clusters within different subspaces (a selection of one or more dimensions)
}
\usage{
SubspaceClustering(Data,ClusterNo,DimSubspace,

method='orclus',PlotIt=FALSE,OrclusInitialClustersNo=ClusterNo+2,...)
}
\details{
"The underlying assumption is that we can find valid clusters which are defined by only a subset of dimensions (it is not needed to have the agreement of all N features).The resulting clusters may be overlapping both in the space of features and observations" [Source: URL]. 

}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{[1:n,1:d] matrix of dataset to be clustered. It consists of n cases or d-dimensional data points. Every case has d attributes, variables or features.}

\item{ClusterNo}{A number k which defines k different Clusters to be build by the proclus or orclust algorithm.}
\item{DimSubspace}{numerical number defining the dimensionality in which clusters should be search in in the orclust algorithm, for proclus it is an optional parameter}
\item{method}{
'orclus', Subspace Clustering Based on Arbitrarily Oriented Projected Cluster Generation [Aggarwal and Yu, 2000]

'ProClus' ProClus Algorithm for Projected Clustering [Aggarwal/Wolf, 1999] 

'Clique' ProClus Algorithm for Projected Clustering [Agrawal/Gehrke et al., 1999]

}
\item{PlotIt}{default: FALSE, If TRUE plots the first three dimensions of the dataset with colored three-dimensional data points defined by the clustering stored in \code{Cls}}

\item{OrclusInitialClustersNo}{Only for Orclus algorithm: Initial number of clusters (that are computed in the entire data space). Must be greater than k. The number of clusters is iteratively decreased by factor a until the final number of k clusters is reached.}
\item{\dots}{Further arguments to be set for the clustering algorithm, if not set, default arguments are used.

For Subclue: "epsilon" and "minSupport", see \code{\link{DBscan}}

For Clique: "xi" (number of intervalls for each dimension) and "tau" (Density Threshold), see \code{\link{DBscan}}

\value{
List of
\item{Cls}{[1:n]  numerical vector with n numbers defining the classification as the main output of the clustering algorithm. It has k unique numbers representing the arbitrary labels of the clustering.}
\item{NeuralGasObject}{Object defined by clustering algorithm as the other output of this algorithm}
}
\note{
JAVA_HOME has to be set for rJava to the ProClus algorithm (in windows set PATH env. variable to .../bin path of Java. The architecture of R and Java have to match. Java automatically downloads the Java version of the browser which may not be installed in the architecture in R. In such a case choose a Java version manually.

\title{
Model Based Clustering
}
\description{
Calls Model based clustering of [Fraley/Raftery, 2006] which models a  Mixture Of Gaussians (MoG).
}
\usage{
ModelBasedClustering(Data,ClusterNo=2,PlotIt=FALSE,...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{Data}{[1:n,1:d] matrix of dataset to be clustered. It consists of n cases or d-dimensional data points. Every case has d attributes, variables or features.}

\item{ClusterNo}{A number k which defines k different Clusters to be build by the algorithm.}
\item{PlotIt}{default: FALSE, If TRUE plots the first three dimensions of the dataset with colored three-dimensional data points defined by the clustering stored in \code{Cls}}
\item{\dots}{Further arguments to be set for the clustering algorithm, if not set, default arguments are used.}

}
\details{
see [Thrun, 2017, p. 23] or [Fraley/Raftery, 2002] and [Fraley/Raftery, 2006].
}
\value{
List of
\item{Cls}{[1:n]  numerical vector with n numbers defining the classification as the main output of the clustering algorithm. It has k unique numbers representing the arbitrary labels of the clustering.}
\item{Object}{Object defined by clustering algorithm as the other output of this algorithm}
}

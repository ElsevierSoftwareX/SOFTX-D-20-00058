Description: Many conventional Clustering Algorithms are provided in this package with consistent input and output, which enables the user to tryout algorithms swiftly. Moreover, the fundamental clustering problems suite (FCPS) offers a variety of clustering challenges any algorithm should handle when facing real world data. The datasets were introduced in Ultsch, A.: "Clustering with SOM: U*C", In Workshop on Self-Organizing Maps, 2005.
